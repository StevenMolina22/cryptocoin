# Project Planning

## Architecture Overview

Our Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency implementation follows a modular architecture with well-defined components:

1. **Core Module**: Handles blockchain fundamentals
   - Block management
   - Chain state
   - Transaction processing
   - Network simulation

2. **Crypto Module**: Manages cryptographic operations
   - Hashing functions
   - Key management
   - Digital signatures

3. **Wallet Module**: Facilitates user interaction
   - Key management
   - Transaction creation and signing

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Maintain clear separation between modules
- Keep single responsibility principle in mind
- Limit file size to 500 lines (as per coding rules)
- Use consistent naming across the codebase

### Coding Standards
- Follow Rust idioms and best practices
- Document public APIs with doc comments
- Add reasoning comments for complex logic
- Use consistent error handling approach

### Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Create integration tests for end-to-end flows
- Test edge cases thoroughly
- Add property-based tests for critical components

## Future Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Stability (Short-term)
- Complete the existing implementation of transaction validation
- Improve UTXO management with canonical and dynamic sets
- Enhance error handling throughout the codebase
- Add comprehensive test coverage

### Phase 2: Network Implementation (Mid-term)
- Replace network simulation with actual P2P networking
- Implement proper node discovery and communication
- Add blockchain synchronization between nodes
- Develop fork resolution mechanisms

### Phase 3: User Experience (Long-term)
- Implement a CLI for interacting with the blockchain
- Add RPC interfaces for programmatic interaction
- Develop a web interface for user-friendly access
- Add wallet backup and recovery features

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Future)
- Implement transaction fees and fee prioritization
- Add support for simple smart contracts
- Enhance security and privacy features
- Implement advanced consensus mechanisms (optional)

## Design Decisions

### UTXO Model
We've chosen the UTXO model (like Bitcoin) rather than an account-based model (like Ethereum) for our cryptocurrency. This provides:
- Better privacy (new addresses for each transaction)
- Simpler parallelization of transaction verification
- Natural support for partial spending

### Proof of Work
Our consensus algorithm is based on Proof of Work, which:
- Provides a clear mechanism for reaching consensus
- Is battle-tested in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
- Is relatively simple to implement compared to alternatives

### Modular Architecture
We've designed the system with modularity in mind:
- Components can be replaced or enhanced independently
- Testing is simpler with clear boundaries
- Future development can proceed in parallel

## Maintenance Practices

- Regular code reviews to maintain quality
- Continuous integration to catch issues early
- Documentation updates alongside code changes
- Regular dependency updates to address security concerns

## Collaboration Guidelines

- Use descriptive commit messages
- Update TASKS.md when completing tasks
- Add TODOs in code for future improvements
- Maintain up-to-date documentation
- Discuss significant architectural changes before implementation
